This module will serve to hold the functions relating to loading and unloading
(encoding and decoding, in the case of json use) DEM files.

TODO: Decide how to save DEM files
    1. Maybe I could do a folder, and within that folder, include files?
    2. One massive file (this seems impractical and messy)
